#### SETUP INFO ####
####################

To run the jupyter notebooks within this repository a conda installation with an R/Python environment is required.
If you don't have conda you can download it here: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you already have conda or have just installed it you can create a new conda environment from the
meto_krig.yml file included in the repository. This can be accomplished by running:

	conda env create -f meteo_krig.yml

Next activate the environment:

	conda activate meteo_krig

Before you can run the first example notebook (R_LatticeKrig_example.ipynb) you'll need to install
several R libraries. Type R and click enter to run the R programming language from the terminal. (R is installed as a part of the conda environment created above).
Run the following command to install R packages necessary to run the R Kriging example.

install.Packages(c("ncdf4","spam64","fields","LatticeKrig"))

Now you can startup jupyter notebook by running:

	jupyter-notebook

This will pull up a browser window. Navigate to the folder notebooks/ and select a notebook to open.
To run the notebook step-by-step click on the segment and press the play button.

Note: before running the notebooks in this repository make sure you've downloaded the data files from
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_fmKZLU2xQNMwt6SENJBL8bWs3OoSXic/view?usp=sharing

Once you've downloaded the data unzip the tarfile in the meteo-krig/ directory (i.e. the directory that SETUP.txt is in)

Your directory structure should look as follows:

meteo_krig/
--- notebooks/
--- data/
    --- FRK/
    --- KF/
    --- Kriging
    --- METAR
    --- Plots
        --- 20180414
	--- 20180515
    --- Radar
    --- Static
