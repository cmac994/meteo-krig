This repository provides code and example visualizations of techniques used in the methodology of McNicholas and Mass (2020; in Prep).
Specifically, multi-resolution kriging (LatticeKrig; Nytcha, 2015) is used to generate 5-km gridded analyses of sea level pressure (altimeter), every 5-minutes. 
These analyses are generated using MADIS pressure observations. To account for the temporal variability of observation density/frequency of MADIS, Kalman smoothing is performed.
Kalman smoothing transforms geo-spatial pressure analyses, generated indepentlty by LatticeKrig, into spatio-temporal pressure analyses that are consistent in both space and time.
The code provided in this repository demonstrates this methodology, wherein pressure observations are analysed using LatticeKrig, smoothed using a Kalman Smoother, and band pass filtered
to extract mesoscale pressure perturbations. In McNicholas and Mass (2020) this approach to pressure analyses is extended from MADIS observations to smartphone pressure observations

Note about MADIS:
   MADIS observations are publicly accessible here. Additional observations, not available to the public, are provided to researchers under MADIS Research.
   In McNicholas and Mass (2020) MADIS Research observations are used to generate pressure analyses. In this repository only analyses generated with MADIS Research
   observations are provided. MADIS Research observations cannot be redistributed since they contain Mesonet observations prohibited from redistribution (citation).
   Consequently, MADIS (Public) observations are provided in this repository, in the kriging example, since these observations may be redistributed.

Data (download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_fmKZLU2xQNMwt6SENJBL8bWs3OoSXic/view?usp=sharing)
-------	FRK - fixed rank kriging 
	   5-km kriging analyses of MADIS Research observations.

-------	KF - kalman filtered/smoothed 
	   3D dataset containing full day of 5-min kriging analyses that have been smoothed using the RTS (kalman) smoother 
	   Kalman smoothing was performed using a sliding 2-hour window with an overlap of 1-hour. 

-------	Kriging - Input and output directories for R kriging example.
	   Input: publicly available MADIS observations (approved for redistribution) within the analysis domain (-105.5 to -70.5 W, 28.5 - 48.5 N)
	   Output: kriging analyses and kriging prediction (standard) error generated using publicly available MADIS observations provided in krig_in

-------	METAR - verification observations
	   Selection of three metar stations (one urban, one suburban, one rural) for comparison with madis kriging analyses before and after kalman smoothing
	   
-------	Plots - directory storing images and movies of pressure analyses
	 
-------	Radar - n0r composite reflectivity
	   3D dataset containing full day of 5-min composite reflectivity analyses with a data resolution of 0.5 dBZ and spatial resolution of ~0.01 decimal degrees 

-------	Static - ancillary data files
	    hrrr_static -> covariates for LatticeKrig
            landsea -> land/sea mask for masking pressure analyses over bodies of water

Notebooks
------- funcs.py - common functions used in python notebooks

------- R_LatticeKrig_example.ipynb
           Demonstrates use of LatticeKrig R package for interpolating in situ pressure observations from MADIS to a 5-km grid.

------- LatticeKrig_Analysis.ipynb 
	   Visualization of LatticeKrig analyses produced in R_LatticeKrig_example.ipynb. Includes comparison between analysis generated
           using MADIS Research observations (used in paper) and publicly available MADIS observations (included in the repository)

------- LatticeKrig_Kalman_Smoothing.ipynb
           Shows how Kalman smoothing is used to transform 5-min pressure analyses, generated individually with LatticeKrig, into 
           spatio-temporal pressure analyses by smoothing windowed time-series at each grid point in the domain.
           Comparison to METAR observations is provided for a selection of three sites (one urban, one suburban, and one rural).
           Kalman Smoothing has a minimal impact on absolute accuracy, but greatly improves relative accuracy which is important for pressure perturbation analysis

------- LatticeKrig_KF_Analysis
           Examples showing the end result of kriging and Kalman smoothing. 
              - Synoptic pressure analyses from 04/14/18 showing a low pressure system propagating across the Central U.S.
              - Pressure analyses and Composite Reflectivity from Derecho event in the Mid-Atlantic (05/15/18).
              - Pressure perturbation analysis from the Derecho event.
