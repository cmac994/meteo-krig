This repository provides code and example visualizations of techniques used in the methodology of McNicholas and Mass (2021a; in review) and McNicholas and Mass (2021b; in prep). 

*McNicholas and Mass (2021a)*

Multi-resolution kriging (LatticeKrig; Nychka et al., 2015) is used to generate 5-km gridded analyses of sea level pressure (altimeter), every 5-minutes. These analyses are generated using [MADIS](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_sfc.shtml) pressure observations, which include pressure observations from [METARs](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_metar.shtml) and [Mesonets](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_mesonet.shtml). To account for the temporal variability of MADIS observation density/frequency, Kalman smoothing is performed. Kalman smoothing transforms geo-spatial pressure analyses, generated with LatticeKrig, into spatio-temporal pressure analyses that are consistent in both space and time. 

The code provided in this repository demonstrates this methodology, wherein pressure observations are analysed using LatticeKrig, smoothed using a Kalman Smoother, and band pass filtered to extract mesoscale pressure perturbations. In McNicholas and Mass (2020) this approach to pressure analyses is extended from MADIS pressure observations to smartphone pressure observations.

### Setup

Please read the **SETUP.txt** file before attempting to run the jupyter notebooks provided in this repository. This file contains
instructions for setting up an R/Python conda environment containing the packages used in jupyter notebooks. In addition, please download the data.tar.gz available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q418t9YtHSTO01FbQH-eCprvaReaf2XU/view?usp=sharing). This archive contains MADIS pressure and radar analyses used in jupyter notebook examples.

### Notes about MADIS:
Additional observations, not available to the public, are provided to researchers by the Meteorological Data Assimilation Ingest System ([MADIS](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/)). In McNicholas and Mass (2020), MADIS Research observations were used to generate pressure analyses. The data archive contains pressure analyses generated with MADIS Research observations but not the raw data (i.e., point observations). MADIS Research observations cannot be redistributed since they contain Mesonet observations [prohibited](https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_restrictions.shtml) from redistribution. For this reason, point-observations in the data archive are limited to MADIS pressure observations approved for public release.

#### Notebooks

- *Surface Analysis*
   - Kriging   
      - Demonstrates the use of the LatticeKrig R package for interpolating *in situ* surface observations from MADIS onto a 5-km regular grid.

   - RTS_Analysis
      - Shows how Kalman smoothing is used to transform 5-min pressure analyses, generated individually with LatticeKrig, into 
      spatio-temporal pressure analyses by smoothing windowed time-series at each grid point in the domain.
      A comparison to METAR observations is provided at three sites (one urban, one suburban, and one rural).
      Kalman Smoothing has a minimal impact on absolute accuracy, but greatly improves relative accuracy which is important for pressure perturbation analysis
      - Provides examples for pressure, temperature, moisture, and wind which show the end result of kriging and Kalman smoothing. A comparison between surface analyses   
      generated using MADIS Research observations and publicly available MADIS observations is also performed.

   - *SurfaceAnalysis.ipynb*
      -  Combines smarpthone pressure analyses with composite reflectivity and MADIS analyses of temperature, mositure, and wind to create gridded objective analyses.
      -  Demonstrates how mesoscale temperature, moisture, and wind perturbations are extracted from gridded analyses using band-pass filtering. 
      -  Produces animations depicting the evolution of mesoscale pressure perturbations associated with a convective event (Derecho) in the Mid-Atlantic region.
