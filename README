# meteo-krig

	This repository provides code and example visualizations of techniques used in the methodology of McNicholas and Mass (2020; in Prep). More specifically, multi-resolution kriging (LatticeKrig; Nytcha, 2015) is used to generate 5-km gridded analyses of sea level pressure (altimeter), every 5-minutes.
These analyses are generated using MADIS pressure observations. To account for the temporal variability of observation density/frequency of MADIS, Kalman smoothing is performed.
Kalman smoothing transforms geo-spatial pressure analyses, generated indepentlty by LatticeKrig, into spatio-temporal pressure analyses that are consistent in both space and time.
The code provided in this repository demonstrates this methodology, wherein pressure observations are analysed using LatticeKrig, smoothed using a Kalman Smoother, and band pass filtered
to extract mesoscale pressure perturbations. In McNicholas and Mass (2020) this approach to pressure analyses is extended from MADIS observations to smartphone pressure observations

## Notes about MADIS:
	MADIS observations are publicly accessible here. Additional observations, not available to the public, are provided to researchers under MADIS Research.
In McNicholas and Mass (2020) MADIS Research observations are used to generate pressure analyses. In this repository only analyses generated with MADIS Research
observations are provided. MADIS Research observations cannot be redistributed since they contain Mesonet observations prohibited from redistribution (citation).
Consequently, MADIS (Public) observations are provided in this repository, in the kriging example, since these observations may be redistributed.

## Notebooks

- R_LatticeKrig_example.ipynb
   Demonstrates use of LatticeKrig R package for interpolating in situ pressure observations from MADIS to a 5-km grid.

- LatticeKrig_Analysis.ipynb 
   Visualization of LatticeKrig analyses produced in R_LatticeKrig_example.ipynb. Includes comparison between analysis generated
   using MADIS Research observations (used in paper) and publicly available MADIS observations (included in the repository)

- LatticeKrig_Kalman_Smoothing.ipynb
   Shows how Kalman smoothing is used to transform 5-min pressure analyses, generated individually with LatticeKrig, into 
   spatio-temporal pressure analyses by smoothing windowed time-series at each grid point in the domain.
   Comparison to METAR observations is provided for a selection of three sites (one urban, one suburban, and one rural).
   Kalman Smoothing has a minimal impact on absolute accuracy, but greatly improves relative accuracy which is important for pressure perturbation analysis

- LatticeKrig_KF_Analysis
   Examples showing the end result of kriging and Kalman smoothing.
